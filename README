#Known bugs
1. In multiple display system the aspect ratio is broken.
In multiple display system the SDL_GetVideoInfo function in libSDL v1.2 reports the combined resolutions of all displays.
This makes the aspect ratio broken as the reader opens window in the current display only.
It may be fixed by hardcoding the resolution to the main display in moth_gui.cpp in moth_gui::init_video() function by chenging the following lines:
 width = info->current_w;
 height = info->current_h;

In libSDL v2.0 this problem should be resolved.

#Note
Note: Moth has been developed and tested on Debian 0.6 and it works with the above libs and tools that can be found in Debian stable repository.
